### Release Notes - Version 1.0.16

#### New Features

1. **Logger Functionality**:
   - Introduced enhanced `logger_execute` functionality for more detailed logging throughout the application. This allows developers to track and log various database interactions (e.g., connections, queries, table manipulations) with clear and meaningful messages.
   - Example Logs:
     - `‚ú® Creating model: \`modelName\``
     - `üîÑ Starting model synchronization...`
     - `‚ùå Error initializing model: \`modelName\`: Error message`

   This feature improves debugging and enhances the overall visibility of database operations.

2. **Updated `getConfig` Function**:
   - The `getConfig` function has been updated to handle multiple configurations for both pool and connection-based instances.
   - Returns:
     - ConnectionConfig or PoolConfig, if available.
     - If no config is available, it parses the MySQL URL string and returns the configuration parsed from the URL.

   This improvement provides flexibility and ensures better configuration management for both single connections and connection pools.

   **Example Usage**:

   ```ts
   const config = db.getConfig();
   console.log(config); // Logs the current connection or pool config
   ```

3. **Version 1.0.16 Update**:
   - This release marks the addition of the logging feature, improvements to the `getConfig` function, and several internal fixes that improve performance and stability.
   - Version 1.0.16 includes stability enhancements related to table synchronization and handling dynamic queries for different table configurations.

#### Updates & Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Table Synchronization**:
   - Improved synchronization of models with the database, including the ability to modify or add columns based on the current model schema.
   - Logs are added for each significant change during model synchronization, including:
     - `üõ†Ô∏è Synchronizing model: \`tableName\``
     - `üîÑ Starting model synchronization...`

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Detailed error logging has been implemented across all database operations to ensure that errors are caught, logged, and handled appropriately.
   - This allows for better traceability and quick identification of issues during execution.

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - A more flexible approach to handling configurations for database connections (single or pool-based) using either `ConnectionOptions` or `PoolOptions` as input parameters.
   - Support for parsing MySQL URLs directly into configurations for easier management.

#### Example Usage

```ts
// Logger function to log a message
this.dbInstance.logger_execute('üîÑ Starting model synchronization...');
this.dbInstance.logger_execute('üõ†Ô∏è Synchronizing model: `myTable`');

// Accessing and logging database configuration
const config = this.dbInstance.getConfig();
console.log(config); // Logs current configuration (connection or pool)

// Initialize model
MyModel.init('myDatabase.myTable', modelAttributes, dbInstance, options);
```
