### Release Notes: Version 1.0.23

**Date Released:** December 31, 2024

#### New Features

1. **Enhanced SQL Query Builder**  
   - **Filter Enhancements:** The `dbnxCondition` function now supports more flexible filter conditions, including `IN`, `NOT IN`, `BETWEEN`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `IN RANGE`, `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`, `REGEXP`, and logical conditions like `$or`, `$and`.
   - **Pattern Matching Improvements:** Enhanced pattern handling for SQL `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`, and `REGEXP` operators with proper sanitization and escape handling.
   - **Null Checks:** Added support for `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` conditions in SQL queries.
   - **Improved Range Checks:** Added `inRange` and `BETWEEN` checks with clearer handling of number ranges.

2. **Refined Data Sanitization:**  
   - `sanitize()` method now automatically escapes special characters to protect against SQL injection and ensures safe query generation.

3. **Better Logical Operations:**  
   - The `$and` and `$or` operators are now more easily managed, allowing complex filter combinations for better flexibility in query construction.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where `IN` and `NOT IN` conditions were not being sanitized correctly for arrays of values.
- Resolved an issue with `BETWEEN` and `NOT BETWEEN` conditions where boundary values were not properly escaped.

#### Documentation Updates

- The type definitions for `FilterValue` and `Filters` have been updated to reflect new features and filter conditions.
- Added examples for common use cases of the `dbnxCondition` function.
- Improved inline comments and documentation for SQL generation, especially for pattern matching and range-based filters.

#### Example Update

Hereâ€™s an updated example showcasing the use of the new filter conditions:

```typescript
const filters: Filters = {
    status: "active",
    price: { between: [1000, 5000] },
    tags: ["electronics", "home"],
    location: { notIn: ["New York", "California"] },
    stock: { inRange: [10, 50] },
    updatedAt: { isNull: true },
    title: { like: "%phone%" },
    discount: {
        eq: 34
    },
    description: { notLike: "%old%" },
    color: {
        $or: [
            { like: "red" },
            { like: "blue" },
        ],
    },
    $and: {
        category: "electronics",
        brand: { regexp: "^Samsung" },
    },
};
```
