### Delete Query Documentation Example for `db.delete()`

---

### 1. **Simple DELETE with WHERE Condition**

Delete rows from the `employees` table where the `age` is greater than 60:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('employees', {
    where: 'age > 60',
    limit: 10
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM employees WHERE age > 60 LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. **DELETE with INNER JOIN**

Delete rows from the `orders` table where the `status` is "pending" and join with the `customers` table based on the `customer_id`:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('orders', {
    where: 'status = "pending"',
    joins: [
        { type: 'INNER JOIN', table: 'customers', on: 'orders.customer_id = customers.id' }
    ]
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM orders INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id WHERE status = "pending";
```

### 3. **DELETE with LEFT JOIN**

Delete rows from the `products` table where the `price` is lower than 100, while joining with the `categories` table using a `LEFT JOIN`:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('products', {
    where: 'price < 100',
    joins: [
        { type: 'LEFT JOIN', table: 'categories', on: 'products.category_id = categories.id' }
    ]
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM products LEFT JOIN categories ON products.category_id = categories.id WHERE price < 100;
```

### 4. **DELETE with Sorting**

Delete rows from the `orders` table where the `status` is "shipped" and sort the rows by `order_date` in descending order:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('orders', {
    where: 'status = "shipped"',
    sort: { order_date: -1 }
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM orders WHERE status = "shipped" ORDER BY order_date DESC;
```

### 5. **DELETE with LIMIT**

Delete only 5 rows from the `products` table where the `stock` is 0:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('products', {
    where: 'stock = 0',
    limit: 5
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM products WHERE stock = 0 LIMIT 5;
```

### 6. **DELETE with Multiple Joins**

Delete rows from the `orders` table where the `status` is "pending", and join with both `customers` and `products` tables:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('orders', {
    where: 'status = "pending"',
    joins: [
        { type: 'INNER JOIN', table: 'customers', on: 'orders.customer_id = customers.id' },
        { type: 'LEFT JOIN', table: 'products', on: 'orders.product_id = products.id' }
    ]
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM orders INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id LEFT JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id WHERE status = "pending";
```

### 7. **DELETE with WHERE, Sorting, and LIMIT**

Delete rows from the `employees` table where the `position` is "Intern", sort by `hire_date` ascending, and limit to 10 rows:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('employees', {
    where: 'position = "Intern"',
    sort: { hire_date: 1 },
    limit: 10
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM employees WHERE position = "Intern" ORDER BY hire_date ASC LIMIT 10;
```

### 8. **DELETE with WHERE and Complex Join**

Delete rows from the `employees` table where the `salary` is greater than 50000, and join with `departments` and `projects` tables:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('employees', {
    where: 'salary > 50000',
    joins: [
        { type: 'INNER JOIN', table: 'departments', on: 'employees.department_id = departments.id' },
        { type: 'LEFT JOIN', table: 'projects', on: 'employees.project_id = projects.id' }
    ]
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM employees INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id LEFT JOIN projects ON employees.project_id = projects.id WHERE salary > 50000;
```

### 9. **DELETE with RIGHT JOIN**

Delete rows from the `orders` table where the `status` is "cancelled", and use a `RIGHT JOIN` with the `payments` table to identify orders with no payment:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('orders', {
    where: 'status = "cancelled"',
    joins: [
        { type: 'RIGHT JOIN', table: 'payments', on: 'orders.id = payments.order_id' }
    ]
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM orders RIGHT JOIN payments ON orders.id = payments.order_id WHERE status = "cancelled";
```

### 10. **DELETE with Multiple Sorting Criteria**

Delete rows from the `products` table where `stock` is less than 10, and sort by `price` in ascending order and `name` in descending order:

```typescript
const result = await db.delete('products', {
    where: 'stock < 10',
    sort: { price: 1, name: -1 }
}).build();
console.log(result);
// Output: DELETE FROM products WHERE stock < 10 ORDER BY price ASC, name DESC;
```

- `limit`: The number of rows to delete.
- `sort`: Sorting criteria to order the rows for deletion.
