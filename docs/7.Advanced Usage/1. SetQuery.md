### `setQuery(query: string): DBnx`

The `setQuery` method allows you to overwrite the current query with a new one. It also provides useful logging to track query changes and avoid redundant updates.

#### Parameters

- **`query`** (`string`): The new SQL query string to be set. This query will replace the current one.

#### Returns

- **`DBnx`**: Returns the current instance of the class (`this`) for method chaining.

#### Behavior

- The method updates the internal query variable (`#query`) with the provided `query` string.
- It logs a message indicating the query change. If the query remains the same as before, a message will indicate no change.
- This method helps keep track of when and how queries are being set, which can be helpful for debugging or auditing purposes.

#### Example Usage

```typescript
// Create an instance of DBnx
const logger = (message: string) => console.log(message);
const instance = new DBnx(logger);

// Set a new query
instance.setQuery('SELECT * FROM users');

// Set the same query again (no change will be logged)
instance.setQuery('SELECT * FROM users');

// Set a different query
instance.setQuery('SELECT * FROM products');
```

#### Console Output

```
Query set to: SELECT * FROM users
Query remains the same: SELECT * FROM users
Query set to: SELECT * FROM products
```

#### Notes

- If the new query is the same as the previous query, a message indicating no change will be logged (`Query remains the same: <query>`).
- If the query is different, the log message will indicate the new query that has been set (`Query set to: <query>`).
